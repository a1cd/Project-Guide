# hello
Here are some example steps: 
1) try and change the title of the website
2) try and add a header
3) try and add some paragraph text
4) add some css by creating a file called `index.css` and google how to attach css file to html document 
   1. hint: its called **External CSS**
5) make the text blue
6) make the text have padding
6) add an image
7) make the image smaller
8) see if you can add a font if you want
9) make the text be on one side of the image, like this:
```

|___________|   idea
```

here are some resources to help, look at these when you cannot figure out what to do next
1) look at the [index.html](index.html) file in the folder. It is a pretty basic website template
2) notice how, for every `<thing>` there is a `</thing>` later in the code
   3) the exceptions are `<!DOCTYPE html>` and `<meta charset="UTF-8">`
3) next, look at [this website](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_head.asp) and read about **The HTML <head> Element** and **The HTML <title> Element**
